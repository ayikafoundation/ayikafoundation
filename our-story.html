    <p style="text-align: center; font-family:Medium; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 25px">Siya and Litisha hail from Mumbaiâ€“a city with a population of more than 20 million people. Such a huge population
    signals an environmental hazard as well: deforestation to set up buildings, vehicular pollution, and improper waste
    management system. Both of them saw heaps of waste accumulated in their surroundings every day while going to school,
    and they wanted to make a change. The change could be made by targeting the root cause, and that can be brought about by
    awareness itself. They saw that people did not care about their environment, and through Ayika, what we want to do is
    make people mindful of the environment and protect the Earth, which is the simplest solution to the climatic hazards the
    planet is facing. Hence, Siya and Litisha started Ayika Foundation, an initiative to target a large audience and invest
    youth energy in this process.</p>
